# Genetic Algorithm for Knapsack Problem ðŸŽ’

## Description

This project is an implementation of the Genetic Algorithm for solving the Knapsack Problem in C++. It was developed as a project for the "Techniques for Effective Programming" class during the 3rd semester of WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology. The Genetic Algorithm is a heuristic optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection and is used to find near-optimal solutions to optimization and search problems.

## Knapsack Problem

The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, the goal is to determine the most valuable combination of items to fit into a knapsack with a limited weight capacity.

## Features

- Genetic Algorithm implementation for solving the Knapsack Problem.
- Random generation of initial populations.
- Selection, crossover, and mutation operations to create new generations.
- Evaluation of fitness based on the value of the knapsack content.
- Termination criteria based on the number of generations or convergence.
